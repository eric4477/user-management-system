## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive designs.
- **Context API**: React's built-in solution for managing state globally.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the API.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code reliability.
- **React-pro-sidebar**: A customizable sidebar component for React.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **React-hook-form**: A performant, flexible, and extensible form library for React.
- **React Icons**: A collection of popular icons for React applications.
- **JWT-decode**: A library to decode JSON Web Tokens.
- **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework for building intuitive user interfaces.
- **React Toastify**: A library for displaying notifications and toast messages in React applications.
- **Fake RESTful API**: Using CRUD operations with Axios to interact with data from the DummyJSON RESTful API.

- ## Features

- **User Authentication**: Simulated login functionality using a fake RESTful API.
- **CRUD Operations**: Fully functional Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on user data.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and responsive user interface designed with Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic User Management**: Manage user details, update profiles, and handle user data effectively.

## API

- **Fake RESTful API**: Uses `dummyjson` to simulate a backend. While there is no actual database, the CRUD operations are functional, though data will not persist after refresh.

## Usage

Upon logging in, you'll have access to the user management system where you can:

- View user profile.
- Add new users.
- Edit existing user details.
- Delete users from the system.

## Acknowledgements
This project was built as a part of learning React and TypeScript, and it leverages various modern libraries and tools to create a functional and responsive user management system.
